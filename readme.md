6. A programming language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. Examples of statistically typed languages include Java, Swift, GO, COBOL, C, C++, C#
   WHILE
   A language is dynamically typed if the type of a variable is checked during run-time. Examples of dynamically typed languages are Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP.
7. undefined is a value that is automatically assigned to variables that are declared but have not been assigned a value.
   WHILE
   null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.

So, undefined is used to indicate that a variable has been declared, but it has not yet been assigned a value. On the other hand, null is used to indicate that a variable has been assigned a value, but it has no value.
